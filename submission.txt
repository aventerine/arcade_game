Project Submission
Download the visual assets and a game loop engine. Then, using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger (or if you are inspired, you can make your own game! Just be sure to follow all rubric requirements for game functions).

Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the Classic Arcade Game Clone Rubric. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

Submission:
    -The master branch is the default Github repository branch. If you wish to submit another branch, you'll need to set it as the new default branch inside your Github repository.
    -When you're ready to submit your project click the 'Submit Project' button below. Due to the high volume of submissions we receive, please allow up up to 24 hours for your evaluation to be returned.
