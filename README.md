# Gameplay

You use the arrow keys to move your person around the board.

The goal is to reach the water on the other side. 

Being hit by a bug will remove a life and return you to the start.

You have 10 lives, and three levels. The speed at which the enemies move increases after completing levels 4 and 8. After every other level you complete, another enemy is introduced as well.

Once you lose all your lives, a button will appear, allowing you to restart the game.
